            <p>
                Aurum is a creative streetwear brand built around playfulness, nostalgia, and bold youth expression. 
                We're not just a clothing store—we're a broadcast network for your style. Each drop tells a story, 
                each piece sparks a memory, and every design celebrates the chaotic, imaginative energy of youth culture.

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                At Aurum, we create character-driven streetwear that feels like episodes of your favorite show. 
                Our drops aren't basic product releases—they're scenes, moments, and vibes that connect with 
                college-aged creatives and fashion-forward youth who value originality, humor, and design-led expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                We blend a "controlled mess" aesthetic with clean structure, using vivid yellow, neutral beige, 
                black, and white as our core palette. Our identity is anchored by iconic symbols like the grills logo 
                and AU/79 icons, creating a modular but consistent visual language that's modern, energetic, and 
                unapologetically fun.
            </p>

            <h3>Character-Driven Storytelling</h3>
            <p>
                Every collection at Aurum is a narrative. We draw inspiration from early 2000s pop culture, sitcoms, 
                cartoons, and the playful chaos of youth. Our pieces aren't just worn—they're experienced, shared, 
                and remembered.
            </p>

            <h3>Bold Visual Language</h3>
            <p>
                Our design philosophy balances strong typography, vivid colors, and interactive elements. 
                Think strong display fonts for headlines paired with clean sans-serif for clarity. 
                We create visual hierarchy that guides you through stories, drops, and products naturally.
            </p>
